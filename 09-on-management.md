# 9 On Management

- withhold info until definitive.
- execs may be married to a formula.
- developers as brain cells. making them leave is a lobotomy
- pissing off developers. Grueling tasks
- developers are not interchangeable
- splitting of tasks across teams

3. Do you understand s = v * t?

The most basic law of motion tells you that in order to cover some distance, you need time
and speed. The interesting, and rather trivial point out of this equation is that once you 
fix one term, the remaining ones 

Velocity depends on many different factors: your team effectiveness, how good are your tools
(internal or external), how complex and research-glazed is the task you have to address, 
new hires entering the team, context switches, but barring disruptive shifts in tasks, your
team's velocity is pretty much a constant. This leaves 

Menacing your team of layoffs, or proposing incentives will not change
velocity. It will just increase time (they will work overtime), but this
affects velocity (people are tired, introduce more bugs, skip over important
details) so the net result is less motivated individuals and a lousy product.

5. Do you plan ahead?

Employees get sick, or leave. Do you account for that?
Do you account how to react to the increase in amount of employees? who trains them?
who buys and installs their computers? 

- Undefined long term strategic goal, both in scope and in excessive verbosity of the presentations that dilute the key points.

- The illness policy makes people come to work while sick, spreading the illness and reducing productivity.
- Poor management tools.
- constant panic mode is indicative of poor initial technical planning

7. Do you encourage removing obstacles?

employee has a problem and can't solve it. What should he do? Spend one hour in front of the
screen trying to figure it out. ask the other guy who in 5 minutes knows the problem and fixes it.
Disruption.

9. Management hires developers and treat developers all the same. Do you have a technical lead and a project manager?

- strong reluctance of the executive to finance improvement of our tools, offloading these tasks to either "side projects" or as "consequences" of other development. Leaving this to personal initiative leads to unresponsiveness and uncoordination.
management pet projects that don't address the business need.
