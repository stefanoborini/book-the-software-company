# Notes to expand

# On Agile practice

- people still involved in other tasks
- short sprints and late planning.
- lack of developer story concept.
- end of sprints are not project deadlines.

# On Documentation

- mess manager
- the confluence black hole. Lack of review. disconnected documentation from code.
- if a picture requires a textual explanation, it is not working.
- the documentation big dump
- develop common language within team

# On code quality

- inferior tools
- bad choice and api will haunt you forever
- common code conventions and unwritten rules.

# On code organisation

- everything is utilities.
- implement things locally, then cleanup and promote globally.

# On interviewing and hiring new candidates

- scripter vs. coder

# The phases of development and needs of developers

# Room and space organisation.

- the playground office
- vibration on desks and non enough space.

# On projects

- throw software at a problem instead of a person.
- too many new tools at once.

# To be organised 
- developers are not interchangeable

- lack of spare cycles to optimise the process
- more documentation will not solve. Less, but right and well-organised, and discoverable, and close to the relevant place documentation will.
- sprints always leak
- splitting of tasks across teams
- poor communicaiton and organization of info
- eternal september of junior devs
- internal apis never stay internal
- code ownership: tragedy of the commons, bystander effect.
- jira, windows and everything that gets in the way.
- jira poor standardised workflow.
- tickets that can't move easily across boundaries.
- big concepts need a high level picture. No space to see it or poor tools to represent them.
- schizophrenic development.
- everything priority one, therefore switch context all the time
- withhold info until definitive.
- fluid teams aimed at the feature.
- train team on our internal tools
- running out of spare capacity to improve the process
- boilerplate stuff should come at no cost (e.g. linting, testing setup etc). Must be there
- understaffing. execs may have quotas that don't reflect reality of the business. 
- execs may be married to a formula.
- you can't cheat nature
- solving problem with hacks and solving the hacks with more hacks. hacks all the way down. escalation of drama
- developers as brain cells. making them leave is a lobotomy
- what is your business? don't develop things that are not your business. buy them.
- the language of presenting information (top to bottom diagrams, pointed lists, flowing information).
- the stupid as a, I want, so that. 
- communication channel proliferation (mail, chat, jira, etc)
- flattened hierarchies in documentation. lack of organisation and cleanup.
- death by a thousands papercuts.
- using the wrong word (master plan vs project objective). color as words are confusing.
- developer placement, isolation, room features. open space, noise. Want to kill productivity: put devs near admin.
- word programming
- word burden and red tape
- word itself (bugs), updating the templates, have dumb templates. The Office.
- regulatory vs non-regulatory documentation. difficulty to find it.
- pissing off developers. Grueling tasks
- spreading information that now have to be kept synchronised.
- rtfm attitude.
