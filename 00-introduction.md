# Introduction

The software company is a new facet of industry. It adds a new dimension to the
first and second pillars of engineering: mechanical and electronical. However, it is uncanny
how bad the software industry is compared to its older sisters

Some of the woes of the software company is possibly connected to its young age, but
I personally believe it's not the only reason. Deeper forces are at play, and this book
aims at describing some of them and their effects. Plenty of literature exist on the topic,
but it appears not to reach the decision makers. This book is just an attempt to add a voice 
to the choir, as well as propose mitigating strategies.


The book is organised as follows:

- In the first chapter we will describe the software company, its goals and possible facets, and its commonalities across a various spectrum of businesses.
- In the second chapter we will investigate development methodologies, such as Agile and its consequences.
- In the third chapter, we will talk about code quality.
- In the fourth chapter, we will discuss Documentation.
- In the fifth chapter, we will discuss about management and resource allocation.
- In the sixth chapter, the focus will shift towards expanding a company and the hiring process.
- In the seventh chapter, we will focus on the office and workplace.

# Notes to expand
# On interviewing and hiring new candidates

- scripter vs. coder

# The phases of development and needs of developers
- boilerplate stuff should come at no cost (e.g. linting, testing setup etc). Must be there
- train team on our internal tools

# On projects

- throw software at a problem instead of a person.
- too many new tools at once.
- death by a thousands papercuts.
- what is your business? don't develop things that are not your business. buy them.

# On company growth
- understaffing. execs may have quotas that don't reflect reality of the business. 
- eternal september of junior devs
- you can't cheat nature

# On process
- running out of spare capacity to improve the process
- everything priority one, therefore switch context all the time
- communication channel proliferation (mail, chat, jira, etc)

# On management
- withhold info until definitive.
- execs may be married to a formula.
- developers as brain cells. making them leave is a lobotomy
- pissing off developers. Grueling tasks
- developers are not interchangeable
- splitting of tasks across teams

# On bug reporting and issue tracking

# To be organised 
- jira, windows and everything that gets in the way.
- jira poor standardised workflow.
- tickets that can't move easily across boundaries.
- big concepts need a high level picture. No space to see it or poor tools to represent them.
