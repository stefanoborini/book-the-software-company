# Introduction

The software company is a new facet of industry. It adds a new dimension to the
first and second pillars of engineering: mechanical and electronical. However, it is uncanny
how bad the software industry is compared to its older sisters

Some of the woes of the software company is possibly connected to its young age, but
I personally believe it's not the only reason. Deeper forces are at play, and this book
aims at describing some of them and their effects. Plenty of literature exist on the topic,
but it appears not to reach the decision makers. This book is just an attempt to add a voice 
to the choir, as well as propose mitigating strategies.

The book is organised as follows:

- In the first chapter we will describe the software company, its goals and possible facets, and its commonalities across a various spectrum of businesses.
- In the second chapter we will investigate development methodologies, such as Agile and its consequences.
- In the third chapter, we will talk about code quality.
- In the fourth chapter, we will discuss Documentation.
- In the fifth chapter, we will discuss about management and resource allocation.
- In the sixth chapter, the focus will shift towards expanding a company and the hiring process.
- In the seventh chapter, we will focus on the office and workplace.
