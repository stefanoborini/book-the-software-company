# 1 The Software Company

If your company creates software of any kind, from basic scripts to complex applications, it is a software company.
It is irrelevant that its core business is not software. While this seems to be a trivial point to make, my personal
experience with multiple companies from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals points at how often this fundamental
concept is downplayed.

As a software company, you carry a set of requirements to meet the goals of handling software. You need to handle the software
production chain, which generally can be represented as follows:

- handling of the runtime the software depends on (compilers, libraries etc).
- software, its creation and its maintenance
- documentation of the software
- testing of the software
- handling of the infrastructure to perform testing, possibly hardware.
- versions and releases of the software, and their interactions.
- deployment of the software, either in house, off-site (e.g. with third parties), or in the cloud.
- interaction of the software with your core business
- interaction of software development process with your core business process.

We will investigate each of these points in more details.
