- eternal september of junior devs
- you can't cheat nature
- every time a company doubles in size, it needs to relearn how to communicate.

# On interviewing and hiring new candidates

- scripter vs. coder

Can you use source control effectively?
Can you solve algorithm-type problems?
Can you program in more than one language or technology?
Do you do something to increase your education or skills every day?
Do you name things appropriately?
Can you communicate your ideas effectively?
Do you understand basic design patterns?
Do you know how to debug effectively?
Do you test your own code?
Do you share your knowledge?
Do you use the best tools for your job?
Can you build an actual application?

10. Do you ask relevant questions at the interview?

I lost count of how many times I've been asked to traverse a tree depth first at a job interview.
The problem I have with this kind of question is that they are irrelevant. I have 10 years
of experience in scientific coding, and never in my own career I had to traverse a tree depth 
first. If I have to, I use networkx. No job position for a senior level coding requires you to be
able to traverse a tree depth first.

What is then, a relevant question for a job interview? There's only one. "Show me 
and explain me some code you wrote, and eventually add a small feature for me during the
interview". 

11. Is the team involved in the interview process?

Any hired person must mix well with the rest of the team. If management is excluding 
the team from the decision process, it is disregarding the most valuable contribute in
selecting the candidate, or asking the important questions considering the state of the
current codebase. Does management know we desperately need someone that is a wizard at
gdb, because we are plagued by low level crashes since a year? Will they keep that as 
a checkmark during the interview process?
