# 4 On Documentation

- mess manager
- the confluence black hole. Lack of review. disconnected documentation from code.
- if a picture requires a textual explanation, it is not working.
- the documentation big dump
- develop common language within team
- more documentation will not solve. Less, but right and well-organised, and discoverable, and close to the relevant place documentation will.
- poor communicaiton and organization of info
- using the wrong word (master plan vs project objective). color as words are confusing.
- rtfm attitude.
- word programming
- word burden and red tape
- word itself (bugs), updating the templates, have dumb templates. The Office.
- flattened hierarchies in documentation. lack of organisation and cleanup.
- regulatory vs non-regulatory documentation. difficulty to find it.
- the language of presenting information (top to bottom diagrams, pointed lists, flowing information).
- spreading information that now have to be kept synchronised.
