# 3 On code quality

- inferior tools
- bad choice and api will haunt you forever
- common code conventions and unwritten rules.
- code ownership: tragedy of the commons, bystander effect.
- internal apis never stay internal
- solving problem with hacks and solving the hacks with more hacks. hacks all the way down. escalation of drama


# On code organisation

- everything is utilities.
- implement things locally, then cleanup and promote globally.
