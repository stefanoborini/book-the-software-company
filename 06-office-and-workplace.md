# 7 On office and workspace 

This chapter will focus on the office layout and choices to make to accommodate
software development in a company.  The Joel test entry number 8 recites

          Do programmers have quiet working conditions?

This is an important point, but needs to be expanded. Programmers, when they
work, need to keep information in their head. Disruptions and noise invalidates
their short term memory and ability to concentrate. Programming concentration
is not a linear task, it's a quadratic task.

However, it's a modern trend for companies to create an environment that flies
in the face of this common sense. Companies strive to feel cool and modern by
providing the "playground office", an environment that mixes together a work
environment and entertainment facilities. Rarely these facilies are used 
not to create disruption or noise. 
Typically, these facilities are used during lunch break or in the first after work
hours, but it assumes that all people are inactive during lunch break or after hours.
In large companies, this is rarely the case, due to logistics (there would be not 
enough space to accommodate all people in the kitchen), personal preference (some people
prefer to eat at different times) and meeting scheduling.

The result is a workplace that is not conductive of work. It's literally coding in a
playground.

Noise canceling headphones are not a solution. These tools exist to mitigate noise that
is white or mostly white. They perform poorly against voice, telephone rings etc.
Besides, the possibility to have a place where to perform one's job focused on the task
should not be an afterthought and something to be remedied through a workaround. 
It should be part of a fundamental design of the employment environment.


# The open space

The open space is cheap. Unfortunately, it does nothing to limit disruption and information
leakage. After the death of the cubicle, the open space is the tragedy of the modern
software company. Want to kill productivity? Put developers near the administrative department.
The incessant phone calls and discussions will kill any hope for focused development.

# Other sources of noise

Noise comes in different forms. Auditory noise is one, but not the only one.
Vibrations, smells, uncomfortable seats, lights reflections, people walking behind you and
hitting your chair, are all sources of distractions that ruin productivity.

Connected desks, for example, propagate vibrations and people hanging over it along the whole
connected set. They are also impossible to adapt to different people's height. Humans are not
all of the same size, and desks that are too tall for one person are too short for another.

Other sources of noise are digital ones. Chats and emails all allow to disrupt one's focus from
the task. Unless the task requires communication, they are to be avoided. Unfortunately, the more time
one remains isolated from these tools, the more there will be to digest when the tools are brought back 
online, up to a point where the amount of mails and chat requests to be dealt with go beyond the amount
that can be addressed within the amount of time available. The pile will always grow, and the only solution
is to reduce the amount of work in favor of handling the pile. More mails will leave our client, generating
more emails in return, until suddenly all your productivity is in handling email and chat.

Developers must have local awareness within the team, and reduced disruption from the outside. The ideal
setup is team rooms, where individual scrum teams share a common space. Local awareness between team members
is maximized, while disruption from irrelevant information is nullified.

Desks should be adjustable, independent, personal. Hot desks are a tragedy for developers, because they need
their keyboard, their monitor, their hardware tools (especially if the company is manufacturing). Enough space 
must be provided to host all the tools needed for the job. Developers are not marketing, accounting, or sales.
They rarely move and must have all their tools and setup optimised and close at hand.


1. Do you have and use whiteboards?

Software development requires communication and brainstorming. Software management
requires keeping track of tasks. The whiteboard is the perfect tool to satisfy both
needs. You can't brainstorm on a piece of paper, and if you like SCRUM methodologies
you need a surface for you task stickers.

A technology company that does not provide whiteboards is seriously limiting its
employees ability to communicate and describe abstract concepts in easy to grasp,
easy to remember pictures. I would think twice accepting a job in any company that
does not have whiteboards.


Do the employees have heavy workloads for long periods of time?

Are the employees often required to work overtime?

Is it clear what is expected of each employee?

Are the employees able to exert influence on their workloads and on how to perform their work?

Do the employees get the necessary information to be able to perform their work satisfactorily and to prevent conflicting requirements?

Does bullying and/or sexual harassment occur in the workplace?

Is the work performed recognised and appreciated?

Is there any risk of violence in connection with the work?

Does the work include the provision of training/development, including work variety?

Is support from qualified staff, management and colleagues available during the day-to-day work?

- extremely uncomfortable tables, both for height, and for transmission of vibrations between employees.
