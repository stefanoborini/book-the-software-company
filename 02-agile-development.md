# 2 On Agile practice

- people still involved in other tasks
- short sprints and late planning.
- lack of developer story concept.
- end of sprints are not project deadlines.
- sprints always leak
- the stupid as a, I want, so that. 
- fluid teams aimed at the feature.
- code quality in an agile mindset.
